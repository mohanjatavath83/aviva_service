Test: Include tests for every new feature or bug fix. It’s non-negotiable.
1. Small PRs: Big changes are a nightmare. Break it down. Smaller is faster.
2. Consistency: Stick to the project’s coding style. It’s about the team, not you.
3. Readability: Your code isn’t for machines. It’s for humans. Make it easy to read.
4. Feedback: Seek it. Give it. Constructive, detailed feedback makes everyone grow.
5. Document: Complex decision? Write down your thought process. It’s gold for reviewers.
6. Refactoring: Keep it separate. Mixing refactors with new features complicates reviews.
7. Performance: Don’t spend weeks trying to squeeze performance if it's not critical. Be smart about it.

8. Reviewers: You don't have to ping your whole team. Choose reviewers based on the scope of the change.

9. Automate: Set up tools for linting, testing, and static analysis. 
   You'll decrease exponentially review time with them
10.  Plan before writing code. Coding is 90% problem solving and 10% execution. Think and execute not vice-versa

11. Learn together. 
    As a reviewer you don’t know everything. 
    Often you are learning something from the code that you’re reviewing. 
    Acknowledge it, it’s a good way of celebrating the wins

12. Understand : the business. Before writing a single line of code.
