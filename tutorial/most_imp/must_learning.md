I used to think that performance of the backend depends on the application logic itself. However, that is only one piece of it, there are many other factors that play a role in the overall quality, efficiency and performance of the application.

Few things are connection management, Kernel TCP/IP stack, security and TLS, protocol serialization, intermediaries and much more.

I designed this course for developers and engineers who built backend and frontend apps and would like to take their skills further in understanding the full stack and how to identify performance bottlenecks on their backend applications.
