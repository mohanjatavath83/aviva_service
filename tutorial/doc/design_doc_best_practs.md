6 Software engineering templates I wish I had sooner:

Writing is one of the most important skills for software engineers. A lot of it is repetitive in structure (e.g. design docs, post mortems, etc).

This post captures my favorite templates that I use to structure my thoughts and save time.

1. Eng Design Doc - Design docs are a great way to propose future engineering work and solicit feedback https://lnkd.in/gBG5aYZe

2. Postmortem Review - When systems break, thinking through how to do better next time is a necessity https://lnkd.in/gG3NsrFd

3. Diff (or PR Summar) - After writing hundreds of diffs, I realized that all their descriptions have a similar structure https://lnkd.in/gMs8esrH

4. Direction Doc - Engineers in leadership roles often have to set the direction for the team https://lnkd.in/gfgbMbqa

5. Eng Project Management - Itâ€™s often helpful to have a project timeline (or Gantt chart) for larger initiatives with many moving parts https://lnkd.in/g7ZuQ6yB

6. Launch Post - Writing when you have results and want to share them almost always has the same structure https://lnkd.in/gp-u2MDn
